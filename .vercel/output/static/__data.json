This was my second project working with Next JS, I learned alot about Next JS best practices and how to authenticate users on the backend and perform databse mutations.\r\n\r\nThe website was built with Next JS for both the back and frontend. I used Shadcn UI as for the website to accelerate the development process and invest more of my time in to the actual functionality of the website without sacraficing the UI and UX.

The project taught me the ropes of web development with HTML and CSS. I also learned some Javascript and SEO. The project was a colloboration between me and two classmates. The group also faced multiple problems when building the website like how to host and do analytics. These challanges pushed us to learn more and accelerated our learning."],"uses":{}}]}
