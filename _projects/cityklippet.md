A website made for a local barber shop, something that started as one of my first school projects in web development but turned in to work for a client. The project taught me the ropes of web development with HTML and CSS. I also learned some Javascript and SEO. The project was a colloboration between me and two classmates. The group also faced multiple problems when building the website like how to host and do analytics. These challanges pushed us to learn more and accelerated our learning.
