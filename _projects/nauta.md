Nauta is a realtime kanban like planning board. This was my second project working with Next JS, I learned alot about Next JS best practices and how to authenticate users on the backend and perform databse mutations.

The website was built with Next JS for both the back and frontend. I used Shadcn UI as for the website to accelerate the development process and invest more of my time in to the actual functionality of the website without sacraficing the UI and UX. For the database I used Firestore as it was the only thing I knew when I started the project and it provided me with realtime data capabilities. As for authentication I utilized Next Auth with github Oauth.

The project was a great learning experince and fun project, u can visit the website [here](https://nauta.vercel.app) or find the full source code [here](https://github.com/JoarM/nauta)
